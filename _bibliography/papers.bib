  title={Scale transformation of place brands: A visual study of Xinhepu, Guangzhou},
  author={Zhang, Jiayin and Lin, Mingliang and Wang, Min* and Lin, Yinbin},
  abstract={Place branding has become a popular strategy to promote place visibility. However, the role of geographical scale in branding has been overlooked. The scale transformation of place brands enables branding strategies to work not only locally but also to rise to a larger scale of cities or regions. Taking Xinhepu in Guangzhou, China, as a case study, we use self‐directed photography, photo evaluation, eye-tracking experiments, and interviews to clarify the scale transformation performance of place brands from the perspective of embodied experience. We have found that both residents and nonresidents do not limit their perception of the Xinhepu brand to a small-scale area but point to the city of Guangzhou. We argue that place branding needs to be understood and governed from a multiscale perspective, with a particular focus on the role of individual embodied experiences and everyday practices in the scale transformation of place branding.},

  title={Constructing an ideal home: Affective atmosphere creation as a public participation strategy for urban village renovation},
  author={Wang(Supervisor) and Min, Zhang* and Jiayin, Zou and Haixiang and Huang, Zirou and Zhang, Longlong},
  abstract={The renovation of urban villages is not only about transforming physical space, but also about guiding the residents' emotional integration in public participation. Combined with the theoretical foundation of affective atmosphere, this paper takes the renovation of Luofeng village in Guangzhou as a case study, conducts a visual study on the exhibition center of the renovation in Luofeng village, and explores the spatial perception and emotional building process of the residents to the exhibition center, to explain how to use the space for public participation to create a "home" atmosphere as an affective strategy for urban village renovation. The study found that participants in the eye-tracking experiments showed interest in the historical continuity landscape and future imaginative space of the display center, focusing on the visual symbols that carry the narrative of daily life and evoking positive emotional responses to these elements. Through the creation of its physical environment, the residents' embodied practices, and the negotiation and interaction between different subjects, the village renovation exhibition center creates an atmosphere of home and realizes the emotional reproduction of the residents, transforming from a space for public participation to a place carrying the residents' emotions about their home and community. Through the case study, this paper provides a practice pattern of public participation for the renovation of urban villages, intending to give a reference for sustainable urban renewal.},

  title={Digital aesthetics and the (re)production of graffiti landscape: A case study of Guangzhou, China},
  author={Zhang, Jiayin and Deng, Huilin and Lin, Mingliang and Wang*, Min},
  abstract={In China, graffiti landscapes were born in a different context than in the West and are gradually becoming a means of urban and rural renewal. They form visual images of digital space through media communication, giving rise to a variety of aesthetic experiences. Taking Guangzhou, China, as a case study, this paper analyzes the spatial perception and aesthetic mechanisms of digital graffiti landscapes applying visual research methods such as photo evaluation and eye-tracking, using images of graffiti landscapes on social media as the base material. It was found that people's spatial perceptions of different types of graffiti landscapes differed. The aesthetic emotions of graffiti viewers with personal practice experiences are stronger than those who have not been to the case site. These differences are influenced by multi-scale factors. In the localized perspective of Chinese graffiti, the neuroscientific approach of eye-tracking technology and the bottom-up aesthetic observation provide references for the (re)production of urban and rural landscapes.},

  title={Evaluations of Guangzhou’s brand building through intangible cultural heritage: A brand equity model},
  author={Zhang, Jiayin and Wang, Min and Lin*, Yinbin },
  abstract={Culture is an indispensable indicator for the promotion of city image that has always been regarded as an important dimension of a city brand. This study uses the brand equity model, takes Guangzhou’s intangible cultural heritage (ICH) as an example, analyses the overall value of ICH in city branding, and further discusses the promotion mechanism of the brand equity of Guangzhou’s ICH by constructing a structural equation model. The results show that (1) Guangzhou’s ICH has a good reputation among residents and tourists, reflecting high brand equity; (2) the promotion of brand equity of Guangzhou’s ICH is mainly realized through three paths: brand awareness → brand loyalty, brand awareness → brand perceived quality → brand loyalty and brand awareness → brand associations → brand loyalty. The research combines cultural development and city branding to provide a certain value reference for urban cultural regulation and city branding.},

  title={How to achieve a balance between functional improvement and heritage conservation? A case study on the renewal of old Beijing city},
  author={Wang, Shunyi and Zhang, Jiayin and Wang*, Fang and Dong, Ying},
  abstract={Historic city centers require function optimization, while simultaneously being pressured to maintain their heritage conservation and utilization. How to reconcile the two is currently a challenge for the regeneration of many old cities. With old Beijing city as the study area, this study innovatively interpreted the value of heritage from the perspective of urban functions, showing the multiple roles and identities of heritage in modern adaptation. In past 40 years, the gradual improvement of urban functions and more even distribution of facilities in old Beijing city comes at the expense of 51.6% of the historic architectural district. Modern urban heritage exists as several types of functions, mainly tourism-attractive heritage as ancient capital’s explicit carrier of history and culture, urban-functional heritage as a stock resource for rational use, combined tourism-attractive and urban functional heritage. Compared with other zones, historic areas have more mixed functional units, predominantly residential mixed with cultural, scientific and educational, and administrative functions. A case study was conducted on nine types of typical heritage sites and their surrounding functional organization patterns, providing references for balancing urban function optimization and heritage conservation and utilization for sustainability.},
