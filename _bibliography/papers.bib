  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Simulating Human Mobility with a Generative Trajectory Generation Model},
  author={Chen Chu. Hengcai Zhanga. Feng Lu},
  abstract={Most of the current mobility modeling methods are specially designed to solve one specific task, which leads to questions regarding generalizability. Inspired by the bloom of foundation models, we proposed a generalized Trajectory Generation framework based on Diffusion Model (TrajGDM) to capture the universal mobility pattern in a trajectory dataset by learning the trajectory-generation process. The process is modeled as a step-by-step uncertainty reducing process, which estimates uncertainty with a trajectory generator network. We compared the proposed trajectory generation method with five benchmarks on two public trajectory datasets. The result showed that the similarity between generated and real trajectory movements measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence improved by at least 50.3% on both datasets. Moreover, we applied zero-shot inferences to two basic trajectory tasks: trajectory prediction and trajectory reconstruction. The zero-shot prediction accuracy of our model is up to 23.4% higher than the benchmark, and the reconstruction accuracy improves by a maximum of 25.6%. The universal mobility pattern that suits for solving multiple trajectory tasks is verified by the zero-shot multi-tasks inferring ability of our model. At last, the study gave insights into the generation of trajectories by exploring the way the model maps trajectory’s representation in the latent space into reality.},
