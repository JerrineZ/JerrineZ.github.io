Hi! I am `Chen Chu` (初晨), a Master student supervised by Prof. Feng Lu and Assoc Prof. Hengcai Zhang at State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System (LREIS), Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). My research interests include **human mobility modeling**, **interpretable spatiotemporal prediction**, and **spatiotemporal data mining**.

Standing in the intersection of <b>GIScience</b> and <b>AI</b>, I believe the reaserch of GeoAI has come to a turning point, and a unified `location encoding` method is the key to this turning. The method shall be able to represent all the prior knowledge from geographers, such as spatial heterogeneity. At the same time, it shall be flexible, so scientists from other realms can adopt the method into their researches without need for adjustment and easily get performance promotion. I really look forward to developing such a method and bringing the GeoAI into the next level.

To achieve that, I have equipped myself with basic abilities. I enjoy exploring all kinds of spatial data. And I am excited about solving the most important geography problems with advanced Artifical Intelligence methods. Meanwhile, I focus on the interpretability of the model, and I try to find out how AI understand the space we live in, so it can guide the next step of my research. During my master study, I have demonstrated parts of my research concepts into several [papers](https://chuchen2017.github.io/publications/).
