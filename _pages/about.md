Hi! I am `Jiayin Zhang` (章佳茵), a Master student supervised by Prof. [Fang Wang](http://www.cala.pku.edu.cn/info/1025/1279.htm) at College of Architecture and Landscape, Peking University. My research interests include social and cultural geography, emotional geopolitics, cultural heritage and landscape, and interdisciplinary approach.

I enjoy exploring interesting `socio-cultural phenomena` and am passionate about using interdisciplinary approaches to explain and solve related spatial problems. I place cultural landscapes in a long time-series and multi-scale spatio-temporal system, tracing the past lives of cultures and their interactions with people and environments. In addition to the basic research ideas and spatial analysis methods of geography, I have made efforts to learn research methods and technical tools from disciplines such as neuroscience and anthropology, especially visual research methods, and these ways of thinking have helped me to better analyze people's emotions and spatial perceptions of cultural landscapes, which are expected to guide my next research. I have articulated parts of my research concepts in several papers during my master’s [studies](https://jerrinez.github.io/publications/).
