Hi! I am `Jiayin Zhang` (章佳茵), a PhD student supervised by Prof. [Dan Montello](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/dan-montello) at the Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests include social and cultural geography, emotional geopolitics, cultural heritage and landscape, and interdisciplinary approach.

I enjoy exploring interesting `socio-cultural phenomena` and am passionate about using interdisciplinary approaches to explain and solve related spatial problems. I summarize my attempted research into three aspects: 1) cross-scale perception. I used the relational perspective of scale to understand local culture, explored the scale transformation of cultural meaning through people's embodied perception; 2) emotional mobility. I focused on affective practices at different spatial scales, such as the emotional geopolitics in the context of cross-border tourism, the urban emotional geography and spatial governance at the mesoscale, and the affective strategies of urban planning embodied in the micro-body scale; 3) cultural adaptation. Focusing on specific cultural landscapes such as graffiti landscapes, built heritage and rural localized landscapes, I placed them in a long-time series system, tracing the past lives of culture and its interactions with people and the environment. These studies were submitted or published in some [SCI/SSCI](https://jerrinez.github.io/publications/) to prove my scientific competence.

In addition to the spatial analysis methods of geography, I have made efforts to learn research methods and technical tools from `psychology` and `anthropology`, and these ways of thinking have helped me to better analyze people’s emotions, which are expected to guide my next research.
