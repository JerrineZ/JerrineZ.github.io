Hi! I am `Jiayin Zhang` (章佳茵), a PhD student supervised by Prof. [Dan Montello](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/dan-montello) at the Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests include Cognitive & Behavioral Geography, Environmental Psychology & Neuroscience, Emotional Geography, and Urban Studies.

I am particularly interested in human-centered spatial analysis and the dynamics of changing urban environments. My current exploration in cognitive and behavioral geography is structured around three dimensions:

1) Perceptual & Emotional Level (sensory access, affect): Investigating how sensory experiences and emotions are shaped by different and redeveloping geographic environments, using diverse spatial visual materials such as street view imagery, social media photos, and self-directed photography.

2) Cognitive Processing & Learning (attention, knowledge, memorability): Examining changes in people’s spatial cognition within communities undergoing urban redevelopment, through methods such as cognitive mapping and enhanced cognitive interviews.

3) Behavioral & Social Interaction (behavioral affordance, sociality): Analyzing how various spatial elements and visual forms influence walking and social behaviors, using tools such as psychophysiological measurements and virtual reality.

In addition to spatial analysis methods in geography, I actively integrate research approaches from psychology and neuroscience—such as eye-tracking, EEG, and EDA—to better understand human cognition and emotion, which continue to guide the direction of my research.
